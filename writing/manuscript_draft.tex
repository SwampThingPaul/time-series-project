\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Long-term census data are necessary to better understand ecological
processes and make management decisions. However, census data are often
expensive, requiring a lot of time and resources. Little work has
addressed the question: when is a time series of census data long enough
to address a question of interest? We determine the minimum time series
length required to estimate significant increases or decreases in
population abundance. Importantly, we examine the ability to detect a
trend with a set level of statistical power, which is often neglected in
ecological time series analyses. Using a simulation approach, we
demonstrate how the minimum time series length required increases with
weaker trends in abundance and with higher population variability. In
addition, we examine 878 populations of vertebrate species to determine
the minimum time required to detect changes in their abundance. We show
that 10-15 years of continuous monitoring are required in order to
achieve a high level of statistical power. Similar to
simulation-approaches, the minimum time required for field census data
strongly depends on trend strength, population variability, and temporal
autocorrelation. These results point to the importance of sampling
populations over long periods of time. Time series less than 10-15 years
are likely under-powered and potentially misleading.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Observational studies and population time series have become a
cornerstone of modern ecological research and conservation biology
(Magurran et al. 2010; Hughes et al. 2017). Long-term data are necessary
to both understand population dynamics and to assess species extinction
risk (citations). Even though many time series may now be considered
``long-term'' (e.g.~continuous plankton recorder Giron-Nava et al.
(2017)), most are still short. Time series are typically short for a
variety of reasons. They are often coupled with an experiment, which may
only last a couple of years. In addition, short funding cycles make it
difficult to examine populations over longer periods of time (Hughes et
al. 2017).

How long of a time series is actually necessary? This question has
important implications for both research and management. Scientists need
to know the time series length required to address a specific question.
A short time series may lead to wrong conclusions given large natural
year-to-year variability (citations). Managers need to know when action
is needed for a population. Therefore, they must understand when
population trend over time is actually meaningful. The IUCN Red List
Categories and Criteria suggest, under Criterion A2, a species qualifies
as vulnerable if it has experienced a 30\% decline over 10 years, or 3
generations (IUCN 2012). For both scientific and management questions,
because sampling is typically expensive, we also do not want to sample
for longer than is necessary (Gerber, DeMaster, and Kareiva 1999).

An important step in experimental design is to determine the number of
samples required. For any particular experiment four quantities are
intricately linked: significance level (\(\alpha\)), statistical power,
effect size, and sample size (Legg and Nagy 2006). The exact
relationship between these quantities depends on the specific
statistical test. A type I error is a false positive, or incorrect
rejection of a true null hypothesis. For example, if a time series was
assessed as significantly increasing or decreasing---when there was no
true significant trend---this would be a false positive. The false
positive rate, or significance level (\(\alpha\)) is often set at 0.05.
A type II error (\(\beta\)) is failure to detect a true trend, or
failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Formally, statistical power
(\(1-\beta\)) is one minus the probability of a type II error
(\(\beta\)). The effect size is a measure of the difference between two
groups. Prior to an experiment, one could set appropriate levels of
power, significance level, and the effect size to estimate the sample
size required for the experiment. This approach, however, is not
straight-forward for a time series, or more complicated scenarios (P. C.
Johnson et al. 2015), as data are clearly non-independent.

For time series data, two general approaches to estimating sample size
are appropriate. Simulations can be designed for a specific population
and question (Bolker 2008; P. C. Johnson et al. 2015). Simple models can
be simulated with parameter values corresponding to a population of
interest (Gerrodette 1987). Statistical power can then be calculated as
the fraction of simulations that meet some criteria. The specific
criteria depend on the question at hand. For example, given a time
series, when is the slope from linear regression significantly different
from zero? In other words, when is the time series significantly
increasing or decreasing? It is then possible to determine how power
changes with a variable of interest. For example, time series are
simulated for different lengths of time. From these simulations, the
minimum time series length required is calculated to meet certain levels
of statistical significance and power (Bolker 2008).

In addition to using simulations, empirical time series can also be
used. Multiple replicates of similar populations are usually not
available, but it is possible to subsample an empirical time series
(Gerber, DeMaster, and Kareiva 1999). Subsamples of different lengths
can then be evaluated to see which fraction of subsamples meet some
criteria, again a measure of statistical power. Similar to the
simulation approach, we can use these measures of power to determine the
minimum time series required for a particular question of interest.

Past work has investigated questions related to the minimum time series
required to estimate trends in population size over time (Giron-Nava et
al. 2017). For example, Rhodes and Jonzen (2011) examined the optimal
allocation of effort between spatial and temporal replicates. Using
simple populations models, they found that the allocation of effort
depends on environmental variation, spatial and temporal
autocorrelation, and observer error. Rueda-Cediel et al. (2015) also
used a modeling approach, but parameterized a model specifically for a
threatened snail, \emph{Tasmaphena lamproides}. They found that for this
short-lived organism, 15 years was adequate to assess long-term trends
in abundance. In addition, Hatch (2003) examined seabird populations and
determined the minimum time required to achieve high statistical power
ranged between 11 and 69 years. However, these studies, and other past
work, have typically focused either on theoretical aspects of monitoring
design or focused on only a few species.

We use both simulations and a database of empirical time series to
determine the minimum number of years required to address several
questions. We estimate the minimum time series length required
(\(T_{min}\)) to assess long-term changes in abundance via simple linear
regression. First, we estimate \(T_{min}\) using a simulation approach.
Then we examine 878 population time series to estimate \(T_{min}\). In
the supplementary material, we determine \(T_{min}\) for related ideas:
calculating long-term growth rates, using more complicated population
models, varying statistical level and power, and the use of generalized
additive models.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Simulation approach}\label{simulation-approach}

One approach to determining the minimum time series length needed is
through repetitive simulations of a population model (Gerrodette 1987).
This is the same approach one might use in sample size calculations for
any experimental design too complicated for simple power analyses
(Bolker 2008; P. C. Johnson et al. 2015). We only briefly discuss this
approach as it has been described elsewhere. Essentially, we use a
population model and repetitively simulate it for a number of years.
This approach requires us to determine values for our model parameters
(e.g.~population variability). As an example, we can take the following
population model for population size \(N\) at time \(t\):

\begin{equation}
N(t + 1) = N(t) + r(t) \mbox{ with } r(t) \sim N(\mu, \sigma)
\label{sim_model}
\end{equation}

where \(\epsilon\) is a normally-distributed random noise term with mean
\(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). The rate of growth \(r\) is
also the trend strength of the increase or decrease (i.e.~the rate of
increase). It is important to note that any population model could be
subsituted for equation \ref{sim_model}, as we do in the supplementary
material (Figs. \ref{fig:min_time_dist_log_pop},
\ref{fig:shark_example}).

Statistical power is then the fraction of simulations that meet some
criteria. Here, we use whether the slope parameter from linear
regression is significant. Statistical power changes with the simulation
length (Fig. \ref{fig:theoretical_approach}b). Then, the minimum time
required (\(T_{min}\)) is the number of years needed to obtain
statistical power above some threshold (historically at 0.8, Cohen
(1992)). Statistical power of 0.8 would indicate that, if there was a
true trend in abundance, we would have a 0.8 probability of detecting
the trend. We also tested the effect of varying both the significance
level and statistical power (Fig. \ref{fig:min_time_vs_alpha_beta}).

In Fig. \ref{fig:theoretical_approach}a, a number of simulated time
series are shown for a set number of time periods (\(t=40\)). It is
clear that statistical power increases quickly with increases in length
of time sampled (Fig. \ref{fig:theoretical_approach}b). Where power is
greater than 0.8 (the dotted line), that is the minimum time required
(\(T_{min}\)).

horizontal, dashed line is the desired statistical power of 0.8. The
vertical, dashed line is the minimum time required to achieve the
desired statistical power. (c) Minimum time required (\(T_{min}\)) for
simulations with different values of the trend strength (\(r\)). (d)
Minimum time required for different levels of population variability
(\(\sigma\)). In each case, the minimum time required is the minimum
number of years to achieve 0.8 statistical power given a significance
level of 0.05.\label{fig:theoretical_approach}}
\end{figure}

We also explored how the simulation approach can be applied to more
biologically-realistic population models (Fig. \ref{fig:shark_example}).
More specifically, we determine the minimum time required to estimate
long-term population trends using a stochastic, age-structured model of
lemon shark population dynamics in the Bahamas (White, Nagy, and Gruber
2014). We found that over 27 years of continuous monitoring were needed
in this particular scenario (Fig. \ref{fig:shark_example}). Similar to
the simulation approach decribed above, the minimum time required for
the lemon shark population was strongly dependent on model parameters.

\subsection{Data source}\label{data-source}

We use a database of 2444 population time series compiled in (Keith et
al. 2015) to compare the predictability of growth rates amongst
populations. The data are originally from the Global Population Dynamics
Database (NERC Centre for Population Biology 2010). We filtered out
short time series (less than 35 years), and those with missing data, and
were left with 878 time series. The data includes information on 478
vertebrate species with a focus on mammals, birds, and fish. The data
also includes information on generation length and census
specifications. For each time series, we also calculated variables of
interest like variance in population size, long-term trend in abundance
(slope coefficient from simple linear regression), and temporal
autocorrelation.

For a subset of populations (\(n =\) 547), we had information on
biological characteristics from another paper (Myhrvold et al. 2015),
including body size and generation length. All 547 populations were
birds. We examine how the minimum time required is related to these
biological characteristics (Fig. \ref{fig:biological_correlates}).

\subsection{Empirical approach}\label{empirical-approach}

We assume that each time series in our database is long enough to
include all necessary information (e.g.~variability) about the
population. In other words, each time series is a representative sample.
We first take all possible contiguous subsamples of each time series.
For example, a time series of 35 years would have 34 possible contiguous
subsamples of length 2, 34 possible contiguous subsamples of length 3,
and continuing until 1 possible contiguous subsample of length 35
(Gerber, DeMaster, and Kareiva 1999; Giron-Nava et al. 2017). Next, we
run a linear regression for each subsampled time series. Then, we
determine the fraction of subsamples of a particular length that have
estimated slope coefficients which are statistically different from
zero. We only look at the fraction of samples where the long-term, or
``true'', time series also has a significant slope. This fraction is a
measure of statistical power. Lastly, we determine which subsample
length is required to achieve a certain threshold of statistical power
(0.8, Cohen (1992)). The subsampled length meeting these criteria is the
minimum time series length required (\(T_{min}\)).

In the supplementary material, we show how the same approach described
here can be used to determine the minimum time required to estimate a
population's geometric growth rate (Figs.
\ref{fig:growth_rate},\ref{fig:min_time_growth_dist}). We also determine
the minimum time required to estimate long-term trends according to
generalized additive models, instead of the simple linear models used
here (Fig. \ref{fig:gam_example}). We found that although we obtain a
similar distribution of minimum times required for GAMs, the minimum
time required for GAMs is on average shorter than for linear regression
(Fig. \ref{fig:min_time_dist_gam}).

\section{Results}\label{results}

We determined the minimum time series length (\(T_{min}\)) required to
address a particular question of interest. More specifically we asked,
what is the minimum time series length required to determine, via linear
regression, the long-term population trend? Here, the minimum time
series length required had high enough statistical power (greater than
0.8) for a set significance level of 0.05. We investigated this question
through two approaches: simulation-based and empirical analyses. We
briefly describe results from the simulation approach and then discuss
our empirical approach.

\subsection{Simulation approach}\label{simulation-approach-1}

We constructed a general population model where the trend (i.e.~slope
coefficient) over time could be a model parameter. We chose a simple
model, but any other population model could be used (Fig.
\ref{fig:min_time_dist_log_pop}). Ideally, the specific model choice
should be tailored to the population of interest. We then ran simulated
time series of different lengths. From these simulations we determined
the minimum time series length required to achieve a certain level of
statistical power. We were also able to alter the parameter values
(trend strength and population variability) of the population model to
see how this altered \(T_{min}\) (Fig. \ref{fig:theoretical_approach}).

In line with past work (Gerrodette 1987), we found the \(T_{min}\)
increases (i.e.~more time is required) with decreases in trend strength
and with increases in variability (Fig. \ref{fig:theoretical_approach}).

\end{figure}

We examined a database of 878 separate population time series
representing 478 species. This database consists of species with a
variety of life history characteristics. We limited our analyses to
populations with at least 35 years of continuous sampling. We examined
the minimum time required to estimate long-term trends via linear
regression.

Across all the populations we examined, we found an average minimum time
series length required (\(T_{min}\)) of 16.5 (\(\sigma\)=8.4), with a
wide distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:min_time_dist}). In addition, as
expected based on our simulation results and those of others (Rhodes and
Jonzen 2011), the minimum time series length required is strongly
correlated with trend strength, population variance, and autocorrelation
(Fig \ref{fig:correlates}). Using a generalized linear model, with a
Poisson error structure, all three of these explanatory variables were
significant and had large effect sizes (see Table S1). Combined, trend
strength, population variance, and autocorrelation account for about
72.6 of the explained deviance, which is similar to \(R^2\) (Zuur et al.
2009), in minimum time series length required.

We also examined a subset of populations where more explanatory
variables were known (e.g.~body mass, longevity, location). None of
these explanatory variables were predictive of the minimum time series
length required (Fig. \ref{fig:biological_correlates}). Some differences
in \(T_{min}\) did occur between biological class (Fig.
\ref{fig:class}), but this can be attributed to the amount populations
are known to fluctuate (i.e.~the variability in population size).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

We explored two different approaches to estimate the minimum time series
length required to address a particular question of interest. We
specifically asked, what is the minimum time series length required to
determine long-term population trends using linear regression? This is
one of the simplest questions one could ask of a time series. We would
expect more involved questions (e.g.~detecting chaos) to require a
larger minimum time series length. The simulation-based approach has
been suggested by others, especially in situations more complicated than
that suited for classic power analysis (Gerrodette 1987; P. C. Johnson
et al. 2015; Bolker 2008). Our simulations support past work that longer
time series are needed when the trend strength (i.e.~rate of increase or
decrease) is weak or when population variability is high (Gerrodette
1987).

Here, we focus on an empirical approach to estimate the minimum time
series length required to assess changes in abundance over time. We
examined long time series and then subsampled each to determine the
minimum time required to achieve a desired level of significance and
power for linear regression. Statistical power is important as it
provides on information as to the necessary samples required to
determine a significant trend (Legg and Nagy 2006). We found that for
878 populations, at least 10-15 years of continuous monitoring were
necessary (Fig. \ref{fig:min_time_dist}). This time frame is in line
with past work on a short-lived snail species (Rueda-Cediel et al. 2015)
and a long-lived whale species (Gerber, DeMaster, and Kareiva 1999). In
line with theoretical predictions (Rhodes and Jonzen 2011), we also
found \(T_{min}\) was strongly correlated with the trend strength,
variability in population size, and temporal autocorrelation (Fig.
\ref{fig:correlates}). Contrary to our prior expectations, we also found
that \(T_{min}\) did not correlate with any biological variables of
interest (Fig. \ref{fig:biological_correlates}). We initially
hypothesized that species with longer lifespans or generation times may
require a longer sampling period. Our result could have been a result of
at least two effects. First, the database we used may not include a
diverse enough set of species with different life history traits.
Second, the question we poised, whether a population is increasing or
decreasing, was specifically concerned with trends in population density
over time. Therefore, life-history characteristics may be more important
for other questions (e.g.~species extinction risk) where estimates
minimum time required are needed.

There has been interest in determining the minimum time series length in
the bird research community (Hatch 2003; Bart et al. 2004; Seavy and
Reynolds 2007). For example, Hatch (2003) used seabird monitoring data
to estimate the minimum time needed to achieve appropriate levels of
power. He found that the minimum time required ranged between 11 and 69
years depending on species, trend strength, and study design. Similarly,
Bart et al. (2004) recommended a standard of 80\% power to detect a 50\%
decline over 20 years in landbird populations. They found that only
about 42\% of populations in the Breeding Bird Survey met their
criteria. Seavy and Reynolds (2007) asked whether statistical power was
even a useful framework for assessing long-term population trends. They
used 24 years of census data on Red-tailed Tropicbirds
(\emph{Phaethon rubricauda}) in Hawaii and showed that to detect a 50\%
decline over 10 years almost always resulting in high statistical power
(above 0.8). Therefore, they cautioned against only using power analyses
to design monitoring schemes and instead argued for metrics that would
increase precision. For example, Seavy and Reynolds (2007) suggest
improving randomization, reducing bias, and increases detection
probability when designing and evaluating monitoring programs.

An important related question, is the optimal allocation of sampling
effort in space versus time. In a theoretical investigation of this
question, Rhodes and Jonzen (2011) found that the optimal allocation of
sampling depended strongly on temporal and spatial autocorrelation. If
spatial population dynamics were highly correlated, then it was better
to sample more temporally, and vice versa. Our work supports this idea
as populations with strong temporal autocorrelation needed less years of
sampling (Fig. \ref{fig:correlates}). Morrison and Hik (2008) also
studied the optimal allocation of sampling effort in space versus time,
but used emprical data from a long-term census of the collared pika
(\emph{Ochotona collaris}) found in the Yukon. They estimated long-term
growth rates among three subpopulations over a 10-year period. They
found that censuses less than 5 years may be misleading and that
extrapolating from one population to another, even when nearby
geographically, may be untenable.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

Our work has some limitations in determining the minimum time series
length required. First, \(T_{min}\) is particular to the specific
question of interest. For example, in the supplementary material, we
used generalized additive models to detect population trends and came up
with a similar, but quantitatively different value for \(T_{min}\) (Fig.
\ref{fig:min_time_dist_gam}). An additional complication is that for our
empirical approach, the subsampling of the full time series allows for
estimates of power, but the individual subsamples are clearly not
independent of one another. Further, estimates of \(T_{min}\) depend on
chosen values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) (Fig.
\ref{fig:min_time_vs_alpha_beta}). In an ideal setting, we would build a
specific population model parameterized for each population of interest.
Then, model simulations could be used to estimate the minimum time
series required to address each specific question of interest. Clearly,
this is not always practical, especially if conducting analyses for a
wide array of species as we do here. In addition, our statistical models
suggest that \(T_{min}\) does not correlate with any biological
variables of interest, at least for the question of linear regression
(Fig. \ref{fig:biological_correlates}). Therefore, it is not possible to
use these results to predict \(T_{min}\) for another population, even if
the population is of a species with a similar life-history to one in our
database.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

We use a database of 878 populations to determine the minimum time
series length required to determine population trends. This goes beyond
previous work that either focused on theoretical investigations or a
limited number of species. We show that to identify long-term changes in
abundance, 10-15 years of continuous monitoring are required (Fig.
\ref{fig:min_time_dist}). In line with theoretical predictions
(Gerrodette 1987), we also show that \(T_{min}\) is strongly correlated
with the long-term population trend (i.e.~rate of increase), variability
in population size, and the temporal autocorrelation (Fig.
\ref{fig:correlates}). Our work implies that for many populations,
census data less than 10-15 years are probably not reliable. This
stresses the importance of long-term monitoring programs. From both a
scientific and management perspective estimates of \(T_{min}\) are
important. If a time series is too short we lack statistical power to
reliably detect long-term population trends. In addition, a time series
that is too long may be a poor use of already limited funds (Gerber,
DeMaster, and Kareiva 1999). Future work should examine other species,
with a wider range of life history characteristics. In addition, similar
approaches can be used to determine the minimum time series length
required to address additional questions of interest.
