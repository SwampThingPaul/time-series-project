abstract = {The new Canid Action Plan synthesises the current knowledge on the biology, ecology and status of all wild canid species, and outlines the conservation actions and projects needed to secure their long-term survival. Aiming at conservation biologists, ecologists, local conservation officials, administrators, educators, and all others dealing with canids in their jobs, the authors aspire to stimulate the conservation of all canids by highlighting problems, debating priorities and suggesting action. The 36 taxa of wild canids that comprise the family Canidae, ranging in size from the tiny fennec fox to the mighty grey wolf, and found in every continent except Antarctica, are special. They are special because they have, as perceived friend or foe, preoccupied the imaginations of mankind for millennia; because the breadth of their adaptations makes them enthralling to science; and because the contradictory facets of their relations with people perplex the conservationist. The increase in numbers of people, the spread of settlement, and the exploitation of natural resources of previously little-disturbed wild lands, together with persecution, are threatening some of these canids with extinction. The possibility that we are heedlessly, perhaps needlessly, mismanaging many of them is saddening; the probability that our negligence will force several more to extinction should fill us with bottomless dismay. It demands action, and that is why we have compiled this new Canid Action Plan. Following a short introduction and a chapter on phylogeny, classification, and evolutionary ecology of the Canidae (Part 1), Part 2 provides the latest information on the distribution, biology and conservation status of each species, organised by geographical region. The accounts also list current field projects, and their contact details are provided in an appendix. The Canid Specialist Groups members are active worldwide. Nine of the 36 taxa covered are threatened (3 Critically Endangered, 3 Endangered and 3 Vulnerable), and one is considered Near Threatened. Six species (7{\%}) were listed as Data Deficient, and 20 (56{\%}) species as Least Concern (Appendix 1). The threatened canids are: Darwins fox (CR). Until recently, known only from the Island of Chilo (Chile) until rediscovered 600km away in the coastal mountains, where domestic dogs threaten them with disease or direct attack. Red wolf (CR). Currently the subject of taxonomic debate, red wolves were declared Extinct in the Wild by 1980, but have been reintroduced into eastern North Carolina, where they are now locally common. Hybridisation with coyotes is the primary threat. Island fox (CR). Restricted to the six largest of the eight California Channel Islands, each island population is considered a separate subspecies, and four have declined precipitously. Threats include hyperpredation by golden eagles and the introduction of canine diseases. Ethiopian wolf (EN). Less than 500 individuals remain, confined to eight locations in the Ethiopian Highlands. Previously listed as Critically Endangered, continuous loss of habitat due to high-altitude subsistence agriculture remains the major threat, along with disease (particularly rabies). African wild dog (EN). Formerly distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, excluding rainforests, wild dogs have disappeared from 25 of the former 39 range states. More than half of the mortality recorded among adults is caused directly by human activity. Dhole (EN). Formerly distributed across Asia, dholes have undergone widespread decline and are threatened by depletion of their prey base, habitat loss, persecution, competition and disease. Dingo (VU). Austronesian people transported the dingo from Asia to Australia and other islands in between 1,000 and 5,000 years ago. Pure dingoes occur only as remnant populations in central and northern Australia and in Thailand, and they are threatened by cross-breeding with domestic dogs. Bush dog (VU). Despite a supposedly widespread distribution in South American forests, this species is perceived as rare, and threatened by habitat conversion and human encroachment. Blanfords fox (VU). Present in arid mountainous regions of the Middle East and north-eastern Egypt eastwards to Afghanistan, where human development could pose a threat. In contrast to the threats faced by threatened canids, several species are thriving in human-dominated landscapes and incur the loathing of farmers and hunters alike. Red foxes are notoriously successful in urban settings, and coyotes, golden jackals, crab-eating and kit foxes seem able to thrive amidst human settlements. Management prompted by rabies control, fur harvest, and livestock predation leads to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of canids annually. Part 3 of the Plan considers nine major issues in canid conservation, namely canid society, conservation genetics, assessing and managing diseases, management of canids near people, impact of exploitation and trade, survey and census techniques, captive conservation, reintroduction and metapopulation management, and conservation education. Part 4 is arguably the most important section. It includes a chapter on the need for setting priorities and measuring success in canid conservation, and the detailed Action Plan for canid conservation into the 21st century. Although we have sought to refine and consolidate these entries, they represent the views of the many experts around the world who suggested them, who debated them in our workshops and in the forum of our international congress, hosted by the WildCRU in Oxford in September 2001. The list of proposed projects makes no claim to be comprehensive, but it is the result of extremely wide consultation. The plan itself, together with the databases concerning existing members and research projects, are all available on the web at http://www.canids.org. The Action Plan was prepared in parallel with our edited monograph entitled The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids (Oxford University Press, 2004) which contains comprehensive reviews of the science underpinning this Action Plan, together with 14 case studies of wild canid biology.

European rabbits are present in most of Europe, North Africa, parts of South America, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in more than 800 islands, where they occupy a huge variety of ecosystems (Thompson and King 1994). Its domestic counterpart exhibits a remarkable variety of breeds showing variation in colour, size and fertility. Domestic breeds are kept and raised globally for meat, wool and fur, and also as increasing popular pets. However, for most of its history, the European rabbit was confined to the Iberian Peninsula where the species is supposed to have emerged in the mid-Pleistocene. We know this from the analysis of the fossil record that in addition, places also in the Iberian Peninsula the emergence of genus Oryctolagus (Lopez-Martinez 2008, this book). The subsequent geographical expansion and successful colonization of multiple territories is as recent as historical times and has been mostly human-mediated. This expansion eventually ended in a domestication process that is unique to Western Europe.},

abstract = {Assessments of extinction risk based on population declines are widely used, yet scientists have little quantitative understanding of their reliability. Incorrectly classifying whether a population is declining or not can lead to inappropriate conservation actions or management measures, with potentially profound societal costs. Here we evaluate key causes of misclassification of decline status and assess the reliability of 20 decline metrics using a stochastic model to simulate time series of population abundance of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We show that between-year variability in population productivity (process variation) and, to a lesser extent, variability in abundance estimates (observation error) are important causes of unreliable identification of population status. We found that using all available data, rather than just the most recent three generations, consistently improved the reliability of risk assessments. The approach outlined here can improve understanding of the reliability of risk assessments, thereby reducing concerns that may impede their use for exploited taxa such as marine fishes.

Such indicators may fail to identify that a population or species meets criteria for conservation action (false negative) or may incorrectly show that such criteria have been met (false positive). To quantify the rate of both types of error for 20 commonly used indicators of declining abundance (threat indicators), we used receiver operating characteristic curves derived from historical (1938-2007) data for 18 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. We retrospectively determined each population's yearly status (reflected by change in abundance over time) on the basis of each indicator. We then compared that population's status in a given year with the status in subsequent years (determined by the magnitude of decline in abundance across those years). For each sockeye population, we calculated how often each indicator of past status matched subsequent status. No single threat indicator provided error-free estimates of status, but indicators that reflected the extent (i.e., magnitude) of past decline in abundance (through comparison of current abundance with some historical baseline abundance) tended to better reflect status in subsequent years than the rate of decline over the previous 3 generations (a widely used indicator). We recommend that when possible, the reliability of various threat indicators be evaluated with empirical analyses before such indicators are used to determine the need for conservation action. These indicators should include estimates from the entire data set to take into account a historical baseline.},

abstract = {Estimating temporal trends in spatially structured populations has a critical role to play in understanding regional changes in biological populations and developing management strategies. Designing effective monitoring programmes to estimate these trends requires important decisions to be made about how to allocate sampling effort among spatial replicates (i.e. number of sites) and temporal replicates (i.e. how often to survey) to minimise uncertainty in trend estimates. In particular, the optimal mix of spatial and temporal replicates is likely to depend upon the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics. Although there has been considerable interest in the ecological literature on understanding spatial and temporal correlations in species' population dynamics, little attention has been paid to its consequences for monitoring design. We address this issue using model-based survey design to identify the optimal allocation of sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates for estimating population trends under different levels of spatial and temporal correlation. Based on linear trends, we show that how we should allocate sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates depends crucially on the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics, environmental variation, observation error and the spatial variation in temporal trends. When spatial correlation is low and temporal correlation is high, the best option is likely to be to sample many sites infrequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are high. When spatial correlation is high and temporal correlation is low, the best option is likely to be to sample few sites frequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are low. When abundances are spatially independent, it is always preferable to maximise spatial replication. This provides important insights into how spatio-temporal monitoring programmes should be designed to estimate temporal trends in spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {The ability to detect trends in population abundance is of obvious interest to wildlife managers. In recent years, the probability of detecting defined population trends has been the most common method of assessing monitoring programs. Such analyses require many assumptions, including a model for population change and a model for variance. To demonstrate potential effects of these assumptions on power analysis results, we present data for Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) from Tern Island, Hawaii. Depending on our assumptions, the power to detect a 50{\%} decline over 10 years varied from 80{\%} to 100{\%}. We argue that monitoring standards based upon the ability to detect population trends should be applied cautiously. As a complementary approach, we propose that monitoring standards should emphasize attributes of sampling design that increase precision (e.g., randomization, bias, and detection probability). By using standards of precision, managers can focus on the sources of variation that can be minimized. A sampling design approach to monitoring standards provides a useful complement to standards of statistical power to detect annual trends.},

abstract = {Classifying species according to their risk of extinction is a common practice and underpins much conservation activity. The reliability of such classifications rests on the accuracy of threat categorizations, but very little is known about the magnitude and types of errors that might be expected. The process of risk classification involves combining information from many sources, and understanding the quality of each source is critical to evaluating the overall status of the species. One common criterion used to classify extinction risk is a decline in abundance. Because abundance is a direct measure of conservation status, counts of individuals are generally the preferred method of evaluating whether populations are declining. Using the thresholds from criterion A of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (critically endangered, decline in abundance of {\textgreater}80{\%} over 10 years or 3 generations; endangered, decline in abundance of 50-80{\%}; vulnerable, decline in abundance of 30-50{\%}; least concern or near threatened, decline in abundance of 0-30{\%}), we assessed 3 methods used to detect declines solely from estimates of abundance: use of just 2 estimates of abundance; use of linear regression on a time series of abundance; and use of state-space models on a time series of abundance. We generated simulation data from empirical estimates of the typical variability in abundance and assessed the 3 methods for classification errors. The estimates of the proportion of falsely detected declines for linear regression and the state-space models were low (maximum 3-14{\%}), but 33-75{\%} of small declines (30-50{\%} over 15 years) were not detected. Ignoring uncertainty in estimates of abundance (with just 2 estimates of abundance) allowed more power to detect small declines (95{\%}), but there was a high percentage (50{\%}) of false detections. For all 3 methods, the proportion of declines estimated to be {\textgreater}80{\%} was higher than the true proportion. Use of abundance data to detect species at risk of extinction may either fail to detect initial declines in abundance or have a high error rate.},

abstract = {* ‘Will my study answer my research question?' is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms – ‘What is the power of my study?' or ‘How precise will my parameter estimate be?' – few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the ‘informativeness' of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions. * We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs. * Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly. * These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

abstract = {Fishing pressure has increased the extinction risk of many elasmobranch (shark and ray) species. Although many countries have established no-take marine reserves, a paucity of monitoring data means it is still unclear if reserves are effectively protecting these species. We examined data collected by a small group of divers over the past 21 years at one of the world's oldest marine protected areas (MPAs), Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica. We used mixed effects models to determine trends in relative abundance, or probability of occurrence, of 12 monitored elasmobranch species while accounting for variation among observers and from abiotic factors. Eight of 12 species declined significantly over the past 2 decades. We documented decreases in relative abundance for 6 species, including the iconic scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) (-45{\%}), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (-77{\%}), mobula ray (Mobula spp.) (-78{\%}), and manta ray (Manta birostris) (-89{\%}) rays, and decreases in the probability of occurrence for 2 other species. Several of these species have small home ranges and should be better protected by an MPA, which underscores the notion that declines of marine megafauna will continue unabated in MPAs unless there is adequate enforcement effort to control fishing. In addition, probability of occurrence at Cocos Island of tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks increased significantly. The effectiveness of MPAs cannot be evaluated by examining single species because population responses can vary depending on life history traits and vulnerability to fishing pressure.},

abstract = {Institutes often lack funds and manpower to perform large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Citizens can be involved, contributing to the collection of data, thus decreasing costs. Underwater research requires specialist skills and SCUBA certification, and it can be difficult to involve volunteers. The aim of this study was to involve large numbers of recreational divers in marine biodiversity monitoring for increasing the environmental education of the public and collecting data on the status of marine biodiversity. Here we show that thousands of recreational divers can be enrolled in a short time. Using specially formulated questionnaires, nonspecialist volunteers reported the presence of 61 marine taxa encountered during recreational dives, performed as regular sport dives. Validation trials were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of volunteer-recorded data, and these were compared to reference data collected by an experienced researcher. In the majority of trials (76{\%}) volunteers performed with an accuracy and consistency of 50-80{\%}, comparable to the performance of conservation volunteer divers on precise transects in other projects. The recruitment of recreational divers involved the main diving and tour operators in Italy, a popular scientific magazine, and mass media. During the four-year study, 3825 divers completed 18757 questionnaires, corresponding to 13539 diving hours. The volunteer-sightings-based index showed that in the monitored area the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but there was a significant negative correlation with latitude, suggesting improved quality in the southernmost areas. This trend could be related to the presence of stressors in the northern areas and has been supported by investigations performed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The greatest limitation with using volunteers to collect data was the uneven spatial distribution of samples. The benefits were the considerable amounts of data collected over short time periods and at low costs. The successful development of citizen-based monitoring programs requires open-mindedness in the academic community; advantages of citizen involvement in research are not only adding large data sets to the ecological knowledge base but also aiding in the environmental education of the public.},

However, the reliability of datasets collected by these initiatives often remains poorly quantified. We compared datasets of shark counts collected by professional dive guides with acoustic telemetry data from tagged sharks collected at the same coral reef sites over a period of five years. There was a strong correlation between the number of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) observed by dive guides and the telemetry data at both daily and monthly intervals, suggesting that variation in relative abundance of sharks was detectable in datasets collected by dive guides in a similar manner to data derived from telemetry at these time scales. There was no correlation between the number or mean depth of sharks recorded by telemetry and the presence of tourist divers, suggesting that the behaviour of sharks was not affected by the presence of divers during our study. Data recorded by dive guides showed that current strength and temperature were important drivers of the relative abundance of sharks at monitored sites. Our study validates the use of datasets of shark abundance collected by professional dive guides in frequently-visited dive sites in Palau, and supports the participation of experienced recreational divers as contributors to long-term monitoring programs of shark populations.},

They are found that the presence of divers had little effect on the behavior of sharks. The study also examined the effect environmental variables have on shark abundance (using multiple linear regression).

abstract = {Humanvalues, perceptions, attitudes and interactions with the natural environment have been found to change over time, with social and economic information used to inform management decisions and actions. Content analysis is applied here to a 53-year long collection of the popular dive magazine, SportDiving, to identify recreational divers' experiences with regard to sharks and rays, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and marine protected areas (MPAs). This analysis suggests there has been a diversification of diver activities with the emergence of passive-observational activities such as SCUBA diving. Attitudes towards sharks and rays have changed significantly, with recreational divers changing from a group that could be described as adventure-seeking hunters to a group that can be described as nature-appreciating observers, suggesting an increase in conservation awareness. TheGBRcontinues to be a highly regarded dive destination, with divers perceiving positive effects of protection within MPAs. However, declines in the abundance of large fish and sharks and rays were occasionally reported throughout the 53 year period. Collectively, these types of data can show changes in resource-use patterns, perceptions and attitudes and provide information that supplements scientific monitoring data. These data may be valuable where scientific data is scarce, historical records difficult to obtain, and where attitudinal change},
