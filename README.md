# Minimum time required to detect population trends

This repository contains code and data for a manuscript on estimating the minimum time required in detecting long-term changes in population size. The manuscript describes two approaches to address this question. First, we use simulation approaches to determine the minimum time required given a population model of interest. We focus on statistical power criteria to calculate the minimum time required. We also study 878 population time series to again estimate the minimum time required. We found that 15-20 years were often necessary to detect population trends.

We are currently preparing the manuscript for submission at a peer-reviewed journal.
